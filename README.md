# Basic_cmd_bash
Basic Linux command line and bash

This is a short "class" to get familiar with linux and bash. 
This is by no means a perfect lecture or class and should not be used as such, this is meant as an inhouse repository to help get people up to speed that have no familiarity for commandline.

The github will host a presentation in .pptx and .pdf format, as well as some basic files and scripts to test some examples
The focus of these little examples or on biological data
