Slide 5
1.A we can now transfer data to a file. Try running Bash_script1.sh and direct it's output to a new file in your personal folder
your_username/bash_excercise1A.txt

1.B. There are always multiple roads that lead to rome, there is the E80, the E45, the E35 and E80 and several others.
Make a copy of Bash_script1.sh into your personal folder(your_username), now use nano to open your personal copy and change
the script to direct the output from within the script to your_username/bash_excercise1A.txt

1.C. Just to understand how text direction goes in bash, now try to combine A and B, run your newly made script, but also 
give it an additional text forwarding at the script level. 


2. Make a new empty file in your_username folder. Now open this file for editing.
Now that this file is open. make a variable called 'print_this_to_screen' and write whatever you want.
Add a second line makes echo output the string within the variable hint! use the {} not the () variant
Next, close the file, save the update you made, and run the file using 
bash your_username/your_filename.sh

3A. Check bash script 2 and 3
3B. Copy both scripts and change the value of 'variable' within the script, see what happens
	you can even try to change the type, see what happens

4. Run Bash script 4, afterwards see if you understand how it works.
	Copy the script and see if you can make me a script that gives me the HAHA number 420 using the 5 for_loop_file's 

5. Run Bash script 5, now make a copy of this and make me a personalized meme :D 























Sollutions 

1.A bash Bash_script1.sh > your_username/bash_excercise1A.txt
1.B Make a copy using 
cp Bash_script1.sh your_username/Bash_script1_copy.sh

Open the script using Nano (text editor)
nano your_username/Bash_script1_copy.sh

inside the script you can write
ls trees*.txt > your_username/bash_excercise1B.txt

Press Cntrl + x, to stop working, it will ask you to save yes or no, press Y, enter, done

Now run the script either using 
bash your_username/Bash_script1_copy.sh
or 
bash your_username/Bash_script1_copy.sh > your_username/bash_excercise1B2.txt
You will see, no difference in output, that is because we already told within the script
to output the STDout to a different location, therefore bash will not see any STDout to redirect
to the screen or to a file...
