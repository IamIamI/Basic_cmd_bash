1. Some user ran a job, i'm curious how much time it took and how much memory it used. The job number is 1499874
Can you find the informaiotn on this job? Like username, memory, and "walltime"

2. just ask qsub to make you a empty file with touch. If the sever is a bit slow or if you are fast enough
you can then use qstat to see your job. Or if the server is fast (which would be a miracle tbh :P) then you can use qacct to see
it afterwards

3. As you noticed apart from our "touch"ed file, we also get two really ugly named files... these are the STDout and STDerr 
from qsub. These normally are put into the folder from which you do the submission. 
you can combine these into one file using the option (-j Y), you can also specify a different name for them by using the option -o for the STDout and
-e for STDerr
qsub -b y -cwd -j Y touch your_username/test_file.txt
qsub -b y -cwd -o your_username/qsub_stdout.txt -e your_username/qsub_stderr.txt touch your_username/test_file.txt
qsub -b y -cwd -j Y -o your_username/qsub_combinedSTD.txt touch your_username/test_file.txt

4. I left an empty qsub script... It already defined everything we need except for the -o line.
Just try to do some things in it, make some empty files, transform some files, shuffle some files around..
Please use only files from our previous session or make new files... don't go mess around in other people's folder :P
Once you are done just send it away to qsub, and wait for it to finish and show you the result :D
qsub empty_qsub_script.sh

5. You can alos check out Malt_053_run.sh, this is a qsub script that shows how to run something on MALT, our main software for taxonomic identification.









































1. Run the following
qacct -j 1499874
You should see that the output says that the user was Taylor Hermes,
You can see from some of these sections that it was a small job that lasted less than 30 seconds

start_time   Tue Dec  7 13:04:11 2021
end_time     Tue Dec  7 13:04:38 2021


However the cpu says it took 67seconds... this is because cpu is calculated based on the time cpu's have done something
If you run something on 2 CPU's then the actual time (wall time) is doubled by 2... 

cpu          67.353s


We can also see he used ~ 0.3Gb of memory, with an average of 11Gb/s average 

maxvmem      302.574MB
mem          11.834GBs


And we can also see that he created some files roughly half a GB in size

io           0.418GB


2. 
qsub -b y -cwd touch your_username/test_file.txt
qstat -u your_username 
or if you know the number
qstat -j your_jobnumber
